# US-States-Game
A fun and educational Python game where you guess all 50 U.S. states on a blank map. Correct answers appear in their geographic locations, and at the end you get a list of states you missed to help you learn them better.

**🎮 How it works**

- A blank U.S. map is displayed.
- The player is prompted to type the name of a state.
- If the guess is correct, the state name appears on the map in the right location.
- The game keeps track of your score.
- When you quit the game, a CSV file (states_to_learn.csv) is generated with all the states you missed - perfect for learning!
